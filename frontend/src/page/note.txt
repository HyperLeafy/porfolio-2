Hello! I'am a <span>software developer</span> with a knack for innovation 
and painting my ideas on the canvas of code. Here's my story:
After venturing through my electrical and electronics engineering, I found my groove in coding,
while tinkering around robotics, crafting code to make them dance. In my free time you'll
find me with a paintbrush in hand, transforming ideas into vibrant strokes on canvases.
Join me on this coding odyssey where every project and line of code tells a tale.
From the logic of software to the artistry of design, I'm on a perpetual quest to 
explore and create. Let's dive into this ever-evolving digital universe together!
